//! Global client state.
//!
//! Two things live for the whole life of the injected client: the JNI
//! [`Mapping`] bridge and the running game / module [`Client`]. Each is built
//! once by [`init`] and reached afterwards through a free accessor.
//!
//! Initialization order is explicit (see [`init`]): the mapping is built
//! first because the game wrappers resolve their classes through it. The
//! accessors `expect` the state to exist — using one before `init` is a
//! programmer error, not a runtime condition, so it panics with a clear
//! message instead of returning an `Option` every caller would unwrap.
