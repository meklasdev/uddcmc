//! Registry of Mojmap symbols — classes, methods, fields — that Mojang renamed
//! across Minecraft versions.
//!
//! The rest of the codebase always uses a symbol's **latest** name (a class via
//! its [`MinecraftClassType`], a method/field as a string literal). This table
//! translates that name back for older builds, so one build keeps working on
//! every supported Minecraft version.
//!
//! See `docs_internal/versioned-names.md` for the design rationale.
